# TO-DO

## HEROKU
1. get application sent when the heroku site is fixed
2. finish heroku setup
3. deploy it to heroku

## README
1. do it

## BUGS
1. when adding a new note, it doesn't instantly update the sidebar.
=> the additions only update when you turn the server off and back on again!
	is this something that heroku will fix?
2. you can't click on the sidebar notes to view them.
